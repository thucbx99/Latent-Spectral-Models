# Latent Spectral Models (ICML 2023)

Solving High-Dimensional PDEs with Latent Spectral Models [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12664)

To tackle both the approximation and computation complexities in PDE-governed tasks. We propose the Latent Spectral Models (LSM) with the following features:

- Free from unwieldy coordinate space, LSM **solves PDEs in the latent space**.
- LSM holds the **universal approximation capacity** under theoretical guarantees.
- LSM achieves **11.5% error reduction over previous SOTA in both solid and fuild physics** and performs favorable **efficiency and transferability**.

## LSM vs. Previous Methods

Different from previous methods, instead of learning a single operator, inspired by classical spectral methods in numerical analysis, LSM composes complex mappings into multiple basis operators. Along with the latent space projection, LSM can present favorable approximation and convergence properties

## Get Started

1. Install Python 3.8. For convenience, execute the following command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtain the datasets from the following links.

| Dataset                    | Task                                       | Link                                                         |

2. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```bash
bash scripts/elas_lsm.sh # for Elasticity-P
bash scripts/elsa_interp_lsm.sh # for Elasticity-G
bash scripts/plas_lsm.sh # for Plasticity
bash scripts/ns_lsm.sh # for Navier-Stokes
bash scripts/darcy_lsm.sh # for Darcy
bash scripts/airfoil_lsm.sh # for Airfoil
bash scripts/pipe_lsm.sh # for Pipe
```

## Results

We extensively experiment on seven benchmarks and compare LSM with 13 baselines. LSM achieves the consistent state-of-the-art in both solid and fluid physics (11.5% averaged error reduction).
